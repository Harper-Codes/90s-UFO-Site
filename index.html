                    out near Rachel, NV when they hear rumbling from outside their camper. Upon checking, they saw what
                    they described as three orbs of white light hovering in the sky about a mile from their site. The orbs
                    moved in a "rythmic sway" for about a minute before flying off into the distance in the blink of an eye...

                    authorities that the light was about half a mile long and lit up their entire 14 acres of land. No official
                    statements so far...

                        many years. Mulder will be missed but not forgotten.

                        landmark of human history was faked. But did you know, inside knowledge from ground control regarding the 
                        Apollo 11 mission states that the crew saw "large bases" constructed on the dark side of the moon and "upon 
                        investigation, were confronted by an alien species and warned to leave and never return". So who to believe?
                        The deniers or the people that were there?

                        When we built the site, it took many long human hours and lots of blood, sweat, and tears... but we did it. And we couldn't have done it 
                        without your support!! From us here at the WCUFOEFC, have a happy and safe New Year, and remember... the Truth is Somewhere!! =)

                        enter the CORRECT info in the stickied forum post!! Many of you are making mistakes and we do not know how to edit the posts!!
                        This is all new to us too. Either double check your posts before submitting or correct the info in a follow up post. Thx - management

                        <span class="date">12/12/94</span>: There's a lot of confusion about the Secret Santa, so let's get some info straight. If you want
                        to participate, you can. This is not mandatory. It's just something fun to do with the community. Again, this is NOT mandatory. Only if you 
                        want to... no pressure. Also, there is no theme, so the gift does NOT have to be alien related... although if you get me, a green lava lamp would
                        really fit my office's UFO theme. Anyways, again, make sure you pay atttention to your person's gift ideas... there is a limit of $50, so don't go 
                        too crazy... I've already had people saying that they can't afford a big gift. There is no need to go crazy with this guys. If you have any 
                        questions, please reply in the sticky thread on the forum. Thanks..

                        <span class="date">12/11/94</span>: Hi guys. Just wanted to say a few things. Firstly, the Secret Santa is still open if you wish to 
                        participate. There is a thread stickied on the forum that you can get all the details from. Selections will be made later this week and info will
                        be sent to your emails. Secondly, this is voluntary, so no pressure to join it... a few of you have reached out to me saying you don't want to 
                        do it... so just don't. Don't do it. This is just for fun. Third, RoswellTruthHunter1965 has been permanately banned due to harrassment... We are sorry
                        for all the damage he caused in this community. We try to keep it clean here and his posts and comments have been deleted.. let's all move on. Lastly, 
                        thank you Jonathan for sending me the UFOreos recipe. I'm going to make them for my kids this month, they will love them! =P

                        scheduled maintenance. If you are participating in Secret Santa, please get anything you need before we take the page down for the work. 
                        Just a reminder, Secret Santa is not manditory, as some of you have come to me very upset about it. You do NOT have to do it, it's just for fun =)
