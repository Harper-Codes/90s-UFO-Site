                    -Lights seen over Nevada desert late Tuesday night... Bob and Martha O'dule said they were camped
                    out near Rachel, NV when they hear rumbling from outside their camper. Upon checking, they saw what
                    they described as three orbs of white light hovering in the sky about a mile from their site. The orbs
                    moved in a "rythmic sway" for about a minute before flying off into the distance in the blink of an eye...

                    -Couple in central Oregon reported seeing a beam of light fly over their house in late January. They told 
                    authorities that the light was about half a mile long and lit up their entire 14 acres of land. No official
                    statements so far...

                    -UFO spotted in Moscow, Russia during an intense snow storm. Sources are unsure if the unmanned vessel was the 
                    cause of the storm, or merely used it as cover to scout. Many residents claim to have heard a loud mechanical rumbling 
                    outside during the storm, and those unfortunate enough to have been out in the storm saw a large shadow passing overheard and through
                    the blanket of snow.

                        landmark of human history was faked. But did you know, inside knowledge from ground control regarding the 
                        Apollo 11 mission states that the crew saw "large bases" constructed on the dark side of the moon and "upon 
                        investigation, were confronted by an alien species and warned to leave and never return". So who to believe?

                        This is all new to us too. Either double check your posts before submitting or correct the info in a follow up post. Thx - management

                        <span class="date">12/12/94</span>: There's a lot of confusion about the Secret Santa, so let's get some info straight. If you want
                        to participate, you can. This is not mandatory. It's just something fun to do with the community. Again, this is NOT mandatory. Only if you 
                        want to... no pressure. Also, there is no theme, so the gift does NOT have to be alien related... although if you get me, a green lava lamp would
                        really fit my office's UFO theme. Anyways, again, make sure you pay atttention to your person's gift ideas... there is a limit of $50, so don't go 
                        too crazy... I've already had people saying that they can't afford a big gift. There is no need to go crazy with this guys. If you have any 
                        questions, please reply in the sticky thread on the forum. Thanks..

                        <span class="date">12/11/94</span>: Hi guys. Just wanted to say a few things. Firstly, the Secret Santa is still open if you wish to 
                        participate. There is a thread stickied on the forum that you can get all the details from. Selections will be made later this week and info will
                        be sent to your emails. Secondly, this is voluntary, so no pressure to join it... a few of you have reached out to me saying you don't want to 
                        do it... so just don't. Don't do it. This is just for fun. Third, RoswellTruthHunter1965 has been permanately banned due to harrassment... We are sorry
                        for all the damage he caused in this community. We try to keep it clean here and his posts and comments have been deleted.. let's all move on. Lastly, 
                        thank you Jonathan for sending me the UFOreos recipe. I'm going to make them for my kids this month, they will love them! =P

                        scheduled maintenance. If you are participating in Secret Santa, please get anything you need before we take the page down for the work. 
                        Just a reminder, Secret Santa is not manditory, as some of you have come to me very upset about it. You do NOT have to do it, it's just for fun =)

                        later this afternoon with all the details! This is a fun way to end our first year, and we're looking forward to all the joy it will
                        bring. If you want to participate, keep an eye out for the post, it will be stickied. How exciting!!! =D

                        <span class="date">11/27/94</span>: Think Tank Question: Do you believe in the possibility of a sentient AI?
                        Researches say that the possibility of a living, breathing machine is becoming more of a reality than we might
                        expect. With the influx of computer technology and programmers today, a machine that can think for itself and make its 
                        own decisions is a futuristic reality. Do you think AI will take over the world.

                        - A strange animal was seen near CA-Mexico border last night. Reports say a "feral dog" attacked
                        three men and a child as they left their house in San Ysidro. Minor injuries were sustained, but 
                        the creature got away before police could get to the scene...

                        - A hiker in Lake Okobogee spotted an aquatic creature swimming through the calm waters of the lake.
                        Upon inspection, the beast was estimated to have been 40 feet in length with a long curving neck and
                        two flippers. It submerged into the water as soon as the hiker pulled his camera out of his bag. He'll be
                        wishing he was a bit quicker on the draw for the rest of his life!

                        a crewman. Symptoms included mood swings, paranoia, and hysteria. Seven ended up dead within a few days.

                        - Deep sea divers say they discovered a large unidentified object deep within the Pacific Ocean. Reports say it 
                        was dormant when discovered, but emitted a low hum when microphones were launched to study it. We'll update our report 
                        when we find out more.
