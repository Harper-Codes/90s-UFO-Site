                    -Lights seen over Nevada desert late Tuesday night... Bob and Martha O'dule said they were camped
                    out near Rachel, NV when they hear rumbling from outside their camper. Upon checking, they saw what
                    they described as three orbs of white light hovering in the sky about a mile from their site. The orbs
                    moved in a "rythmic sway" for about a minute before flying off into the distance in the blink of an eye...

                    -Couple in central Oregon reported seeing a beam of light fly over their house in late January. They told 
                    authorities that the light was about half a mile long and lit up their entire 14 acres of land. No official
                    statements so far...

                        2/27/95: The site is under new management! New mod Bryan Harper has stepped up to the plate
                        to moderate the site. He brings 2 years of site management experience, and has been
                        an avid UFO hunting for years. He replaces Fox Mulder, who was the site manager for 
                        many years. Mulder will be missed but not forgotten.
